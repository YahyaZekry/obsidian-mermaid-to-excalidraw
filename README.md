## üéØ How to Use

### Single Diagram Conversion

1.  Create or open a note in Obsidian.
2.  Write your Mermaid diagram code. For example:
    ```
    graph TD
        A[Start] --> B{Decision}
        B -->|Yes| C[Action 1]
        B -->|No| D[Action 2]
        C --> E[End]
        D --> E[End]
    ```
3.  **Select the entire Mermaid code** (this is important!).
4.  Open the Command Palette (default `Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P`).
5.  Type "Convert Mermaid to New Excalidraw File" and select the command.
6.  A new file (e.g., `Converted-Mermaid-TIMESTAMP.excalidraw.md`) will be created in your vault.
7.  Open the new file and switch to Excalidraw view to see your converted diagram with full text labels!

### Bulk Conversion (New!)

1.  Open a markdown file containing multiple Mermaid diagrams.
2.  Click the **workflow icon** (üîÑ) in the ribbon, or use the command "Convert All Mermaid Diagrams in File".
3.  The plugin will automatically find and convert all Mermaid code blocks in the file.
4.  Each diagram will be saved as a separate numbered file: `Filename-Diagram-1.excalidraw.md`, `Filename-Diagram-2.excalidraw.md`, etc.
5.  A summary notice will show how many diagrams were successfully converted.
